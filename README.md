Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of NBA games. Various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks, are employed to classify game results based on historical game and player statistics.

Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values.
Scaling features to ensure model consistency.
Data splitting into training and testing datasets.
Feature Engineering
Features are carefully selected to maximize model performance. Some key engineered features include:

Player-specific performance metrics.
Team statistics aggregated over the season.
Game location, opponent strength, and recent performance trends.
Modeling
The project employs multiple machine learning models:

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Utilized for its effectiveness in binary classification.
Neural Networks: Used to capture non-linear relationships between features and outcomes.
Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a comprehensive assessment of prediction quality.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% (replace with actual results). The results indicate that certain feature sets contribute significantly to prediction accuracy.

Requirements
The project requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow or keras (for Neural Networks)
